# Identity and Access

Identity and Access defines how people enter CLOIE, claim or use account roles, authenticate with Google, complete onboarding, and move through access states.

## Language

**Self-service role claim**:
A user-selected request to join CLOIE under a role that the system allows the user to choose for themselves, without a prior invitation or roster match.
_Avoid_: Self-sign up, self-registration when discussing authorization semantics

**Incomplete self-service role claim**:
A self-service role claim that has assigned the CLOIE account role but has not yet completed the role's required onboarding data.
_Avoid_: Completed account, role change

**Pre-provisioned role**:
A CLOIE account role that must be created by an administrator before the person can enter through the role selection portal.
_Avoid_: Invite-only when the account is already created directly by an administrator

**Managed role transition**:
An administrator-controlled role change where the administrator must provide the target role's required institution-managed information before the role is usable.
_Avoid_: Self-service onboarding, incomplete self-service role claim
